Python is a general-purpose, versatile, and powerful programming language. It’s a great first language because it’s concise and easy to read. Whatever you want to do, Python can do it. From data analysis to data visualization, web development to machine learning, Python is the language for you.

It was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and was named after the British comedy show, Monty Python’s Flying Circus.
