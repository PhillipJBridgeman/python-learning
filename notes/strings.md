# Strings
A string is a sequence of characters contained within a pair of single quotes (') or double quotes("). Strings can store words, sentences, or whole paragraphs. They can be any length and can contain letters, numbers, symbols, and spaces.

```py
message1 = "I am a string"
message2 = 'I am also a string'
```

Other [data types](./data_types.md) such as integers, doubles, and booleans can also be strings if they are wrapped in quotes.

| "True" (also in quotes) | Yes ✅ |
| 7 (integer) | No ❌ |
| Hello (no quotes) | No ❌ |
| True (boolean) | No ❌ |
