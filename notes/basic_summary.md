# Basics Summary

## Hello World

- This is the traditional first program when learning a new language.
- The `print()` function outputs text to the console.
- In Python, no semicolons are needed after statements (unlike C or JavaScript).
- Strings must be enclosed in quotes, either single (' ') or double (" ").
- Adding # to a line will create a single line comment.
- Adding /* */ will create a multi-line comment.
- Comments are useful for documenting code and make explaining tricky code.
- When creating a variable which is a value that can change use the syntax
    ```py
    my_name = "Your Name"
    ```

## Data Types

- String are a collection of characters that encased in quotas. This data type is a primary data type in python.

## Errors
Humans are prone to making mistakes. Humans are also typically in charge of creating computer programs. To compensate, programming languages attempt to understand and explain mistakes made in their programs.

Python refers to these mistakes as

errors and will point to the location where an error occurred with a ^ character. When programs throw errors that we didn’t expect to encounter we call those errors bugs. Programmers call the process of updating the program so that it no longer produces unexpected errors debugging.

Two common errors that we encounter while writing Python are SyntaxError and NameError.

- SyntaxError means there is something wrong with the way your program is written — punctuation that does not belong, a command where it is not expected, or a missing parenthesis can all trigger a SyntaxError.

- A NameError occurs when the Python interpreter sees a word it does not recognize. Code that contains something that looks like a variable but was never defined will throw a NameError.

## Reflections

- Python syntax is very clean and beginner-friendly.
- Compared to other languages, Python reduces boilerplate and focuses on readability.
