# Collections Module

The **collections module** implements several container types in addition to the standard Python built-in collections, [`dict`](./dict.md), [`list`](./list.md), [`set`](./set.md) and [`tuple`](./tuple.md).

Below are some of the specialized data types provided by this module.

## Collections Module
[`collections.Counter`](./collections_module/collections_counter.md)
A dict subclass that stores counts for hashable objects.
[`defaultdict`](./collections_module/default_dict.md)
Returns a dictionary-like object.
[`deque()`](./collections_module/deque.md)
Creates a deque object.
[`namedtuple`](./named_tuple.md)
A tuple subclass with named fields
[`OrderedDict`](./orderd_dict.md)
Maintains the order in which keys were inserted in a dictionary.
